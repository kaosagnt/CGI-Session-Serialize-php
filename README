NAME
       CGI::Session::Serialize::php - PHP serializer for CGI::Session

DESCRIPTION
       This library can be used by CGI::Session to serialize session data. It
       is a wrapper around the "PHP::Session::Serializer::PHP". Use of this
       serializer allows common session data storage when writing Web
       Applications in both Perl and PHP. NOTE: you will need to store the
       Session ID in your PHP session data structure as
       $_SESSION['_SESSION_ID'] = session_id(); as the return from the
       "thaw()" method is checked for it's existance. "CGI::Session" will
       croak with the error "Invalid data structure returned from thaw()" if
       it is not seen.	Don't forget to add 'serializer:php' to your
       "CGI::Session" initialiaztion string.  =head1 METHODS

       freeze($class, \%session_data_hash)
	   Receives two arguments. First is the class name, the second is the
	   session data to be serialized.  Should return serialized string on

       thaw($class, $php_serialized_string)
